# Activity Overview 
This project classifies assets connected to a home office network. Asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. It's a critical part of every organization's security plan. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk. The task was to create a home network asset inventory that demonstrates asset management and sensitivity classification.

## Scenario 
One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

A home office that includes a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and external hard drive.
You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

- Desktop or laptop computers

- Smartphones

- Smart home devices

- Game consoles

- Storage devices or servers

- Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.


## What’s Included
- Sensitivity categories legend
- Examples plus 3 original entries

## Access Designation Categories

| Category     | Access Designation        |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| None         | No relationship            |
| Public       | Anyone                     |
| Confidential | Limited to specific users  |
| Restricted   | Need-to-know               |

## Home Network Asset Inventory (Examples)

| Asset                  | Usage      | Owner              | Location            | Notes                                                                       | Sensitivity     |
|------------------------|------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Network Router         | Continuous | Internet Service Provider (ISP) | On-premises     | Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices use the 5 GHz frequency     | Confidential     |
| Desktop                | Occasional | Homeowner           | On-premises         | Contains private information, like photos                                   | Restricted       |
| Guest Smartphone       | Occasional | Friend              | On and off-premises | Connects to my home network                                                 | Internal-only    |
| External Hard Drive    | Occasional | Homeowner           | On-premises         | Contains music and movies                                                   | Confidential     |
| Streaming Media Player | Continuous | Homeowner           | On-premises         | Payment card information is stored for movie rentals                        | Internal-only    |
| Portable Game Console  | Occasional | Friend              | On and off-premises | Has a camera and microphone                                                 | Internal-only    |

## My Contributions

The following three assets were added as part of my assignment:

## Home Network Asset Inventory

| Asset         | Usage      | Owner     | Location           | Notes                                                           | Sensitivity     |
|---------------|------------|-----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Smart Speaker | Occasional | Homeowner | On-premises        | Connects to my home network and has open voice access           | Public           |
| Smart Watch   | Occasional | Homeowner | On and Off-premises| Contains private information, like payment information           | Confidential     |
| Smart TV      | Occasional | Homeowner | On-premises        | Contains private information, like login credentials to apps     | Internal-only    |

## Reflection
This activity helped me evaluate real-world device risk and practice assigning security classifications based on context. It reinforced the value of thorough documentation for cybersecurity planning.
