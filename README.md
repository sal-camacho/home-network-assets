## üìò Google Cybersecurity Certificate Assignment Overview 
This project classifies assets connected to a home office network. Asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. It's a critical part of every organization's security plan. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk. The task was to create a home network asset inventory that demonstrates asset management and sensitivity classification.
